            <h1>Idea behind</h1>
            <p>
                Tic-tac-toe is a simple, two-player game which, if played optimally by both players, will always result in a tie. The game is also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os.
            Tic-tac-toe is a game that is traditionally played by being drawn on paper, and it can be played on a computer or on a variety of media. Other games, such as Connect 4, are based on this classic.

            <p>
                    An early variation of the game was played in the Roman Empire, around the 1st century B.C. It was called terni lapilli, which means "three pebbles at a time." The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Roman ruins.

                    The first print reference to "noughts and crosses," the British name for the game, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884 but referred to a children's game played on a slate.

                <h1>Gameplay</h1>
                <p>The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3 x 3 grid, or four in a row in a 4 x 4 grid. 

                        To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares, usually 3 x 3 or 4 x 4.
                        
                        The player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either one player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally; or all nine squares are filled.
                        
                        If a player is able to draw three of their Xs or three of their Os in a row, then that player wins.
                        
                        If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
                        
                        Gameplay is the same if you are playing on a 4 x 4 grid. The "X" player goes first. And, players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until a row is completed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or all 16 squares are filled. If all 16 squares are filled and neither player has four in a row, the game is a draw.</p>
